1) wag walker walks a shelter dog for 30 minutes. so wag has a data api, which tracks how much distance/time was walked based on GPS location. This data could be sent to the shelter to then mint respective quantities of token to the walker's wallet
2) shelter would be the owner/deployer of ERC20 contract, so they are the only ones who can mint tokens. ERC20 token mints 30 tokens to the walker based on data from Wag.
3) The walker has 100 tokens they can send 100 tokens (ERC20.transfer(cup_seller, 100))  to the cup seller who will now see 100 tokens in their metamask wallet. walker could redeem 100 tokens for an NFT representing some physical item or service. Like a digital coupon. which would change a variable on the NFT from redeemed=false to redeemed=true
